# Fundraising

## Summary

Funding is one of the main concerns for think tanks, especially since there are very few that have continuous endowments. Even though funding is what induces the possibility for think tanks to publish qualitative research and generate policy recommendations.

Along with people, funds are a think tank’s main input, which makes fundraising one of the most important steps when starting a think tank, however, also one of the hardest. 

## Fundraising Requirements

* A Donor Market
* People and time
* Investments \(money\)
* Fundraising tools and know-hows

## Fundraising Models

### Core funding

### Contracts

### Grants

### Charging for Content

#### Membership

#### Subscriptions

#### Event 

## Fundraiser Mentality 

Before you can ask for funding, you need to have a clear mindset that you are not being a "beggar" or a "thief". You are making a deal with a donor, who is willing to give you funds because he believes in the positive outcome it will generate, whether it is financially or socially. 

You should set a positive and confident mentality, when asking for funds. If you do not believe in your offer, how can the donor. **Remember that:**

* You have something unique to offer
* You are proud of what we do
* You are partners
* You are not afraid to ask for support
* Everyone is a fundraiser \(to an extent\)

## How to Find the Right Donors/ Donor Markets?

* Companies
* Foundation
* Governments - in your country or/and abroad
* Public Bodies \(Universities, Federal Agencies\) 
* Private Donors 

### Identifying the right donors/funders.  

**Ask yourself these following questions:**

* Which donor markets suit our think tank?
* Which actors in the market suit our think tank?
* What/where are their networks? How do we approach them? 

#### For example: Market Analysis

1. _**Establish and respect excluded markets**_ \(markets you do not want your think tank to be associated with\). 
2. _**Determine top 3 promising markets**_ \(e.g. finance, IT, and Platform markets\)
3. _**Per Market:**_ Establish a list of 50-100 corporations, then analyse and rank the top 5, identify the right contact person \(through e.g. LinkedIn\) 
4. _**Make an Offer:**_ it is better to sent it through these business networks/ platforms, than through email \(since they get drowned by emails\)

#### Five components that help to evaluate a funding model’s appropriateness:

1. _**Dependable:**_ Funds that are random and non-dependable don't tend to help the think tank in the long term or in their sustainability. 
2. _**Diverse:**_
3. _**Acceptable conditions:**_
4. _**Independent:**_
5. _**Transparent:**_

These criteria can be challenged and/or modified. However, they offer a fairly basic yet comprehensive set of guidelines to assess if an organisation’s funding model is actually problematic in terms of its broader strategy.

## What will and can we offer the donor/funder?

There are **2 sides** in proposing an offer to the potential donor.

1. **The Rational Part**: This entails the qualitative information on the outcomes of funding your think tank or project. For instance,the figures you are doing with your think tank or to fund a specific project. 
2. **The Emotional Part**: This entails your motives, the external effect it will generate, and your personal incentives. It is an important point, since you are trying to connect with the human being who is deciding if they should fund your think tank/project. Tell a story \(with images and/or videos\), not just sending in numbers and information.

## The Asking Process

Every donor is different and needs to be approached with different tactics. A research by NPC \(New Philanthropy Capital\) in the UK, [Money for Good UK](http://www.thinknpc.org/publications/fundraising-perspectives/), and by [Hope Consulting in the US](http://www.cambercollective.com/work/money-for-good), suggests that donors can be segmented in order to better understand their motivations for funding, and hence receive more funding. 

The research states that segmentation is useful since it can help think tanks to:

* _Effectively communicate_ with their current funders and acknowledge their support;
* _Concentrate their efforts_ on funders who would most likely fund them; and
* _Determine the probability_ of being able to persuade donors to fund them and/or continuously stay loyal to them.

The study concluded, there are **7 different segments** **of Funders:**

1. **Engaged Champion** - Invests time and gets friends & other people involved
2. **Benefactor** - Funds in order to lead a good example
3. **Loyal Supporter** - Funds because they care about the cause
4. **Faith based Donors** - Funds only if they represent their community & beliefs
5. **Thoughtful Philanthropist** - Funds and supports to make an impact
6. **Ad Hoc Giver** - Funds because he is asked to

The 7 type of funders do not all correlate well with think tanks.The motivation of every donor also varies accordingly. Some donors: 

* Are driven by the cause: such as the thoughtful philanthropist, the loyal supporter, and the engaged champion
* Are driven by personal links, like a friend, former colleague, or university alumni: such as the benefactor
* Need to perceive the cause as a duty to society: such as the benefactor, and the good citizen
* Need to be seen as role models: such as the thoughtful philanthropist, and the engaged champion
* Require an impact, they are only interested in the outcome it could generate and would want it for the short run; such as the loyal supporter, engagement champion, and thoughtful philanthropist. 

Therefore, to know what kind of donor you are approaching, you should:

1. Get to know the potential donor\(s\) as a human being and their organisation/company. By using your networking contacts, profiling them, and/or researching about their funding processes. Try to figure out what kind of donor they are\)
2. Inform the potential donor\(s\) about your organisation
3. Get them involved in your organisation \(e.g. Newsletter, Events,...\)
4. Prepare the potential donor\(s\) 

## Engaging with Funders/Donors

It is highly important to reinforce the positive decisions of the funder/donor for supporting your think tank. 

**Say Thank You** - Always be humble and grateful, and very thankful towards the funder.

**Proof of Usage** - You should be able to prove to them that you have been using the money for what it was intended for, preferably with a documentation. An annual report and if asked, a financial statement. 

**Recognition** - Most funders would want recognition. They would either want their logo to be present or/and shown on every product, project, or event the think tank produces/organises with their funds. \(This is usually set and is included when signing a contract\).

However, you should always ask your donors if they want to be mentioned in your annual report or publication, not every donor would want to. Nevertheless, it is another opportunity for you to recognise them. 

**Show Impact** - This is beneficial not just for the donor, but also for you to have a clear view of what your impact is or/and your project. 

**Communication** - Stay in regular contact with them. Invite them to events you think would interest them, invite them out for dinner or drinks. Keep the communication flowing and stay up to date with them, so they continue funding you and it is always important to have good contacts in your network; especially since you would want to win the funder for a recurring donation. 

**Examples of  communication tools** that you should use **on-going** and **systematically**: 

* _**For Companies:**_ Send annual reports, organize formal and informal meetings, and send Newsletter
* _**Foundation:**_ Send annual reports and stay in correspondence with the contact person, invite to Events
* _**Governments**_ \(in your country or/and abroad\): Annual report
* _**Public Bodies:**_ \(Universities, Federal Agencies\): Annual report and Presentation Meetings
* _**Private Donors:**_ Send letters, phone calls, include in different digital platforms, send Newsletter, invite to Events, organize formal and informal meetings
