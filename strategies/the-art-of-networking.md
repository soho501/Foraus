### How to Approach and Connect with People

#### Use your Setting: 

Whether you are in a bar, a restaurant, or a convention, _**use your surroundings to start a conversation**_. For example, "The attendance seems much higher this year, how long have you been coming to these conferences?"; or you could further ask them where they flew from to attend it. You could also further comment on what is currently happening during the event, just be spontaneous! 

#### Ask for Advice

_**To ask for advice is a great way to start a conversation**_ ****and generally receive helpful information. For instance, if you are unsure who the speaker at the event is, ask someone for more information.  Or in an unrelated manner, ask for a restaurant recommendation or an advise on a common interest. These sorts of questions is a great way to let a conversation flow in a natural and humane manner. It also allows to establish common interests.  Moreover, it always is a gratifying and pleasant feeling to have your opinion requested.

#### Come Prepared

You don't have to do any homework before going to a event, but rather **c**_**heck the news or social media.**_ See what are current topics in politics, economy, or international affairs, even checking out gossip columns. Whatever floats your boat, and you believe is entertaining or/and fascinating. So, once you are at an event, you can _**start an easy and light conversation regarding interesting current events.**_ Keith Ferrazzi , a so-called master networker and author, calls this "conversational currency, " as it permits conversation to flow. It is all about having a comfortable humanely conversation. 

#### Share

Many people dislike networking due to the generic small talk you have with dozens of strangers, always addressing the same topics and having repetitive conversations. No person expresses much and they tend to stay clear from controversial subjects. Even though it's not encouraged to incite an argument, it is _**encouraged to share your opinion**_. Actually, being confident enough to be authentic and honest with others, as well as allowing yourself to be a versatile and interesting person is far better and intriguing than the alternative. So, _**express and share yourself**_, as long as it is in a respectful manner \(of course\). 

#### Ask and Listen

Successful networking and expanding your network sometimes does not require much talking, but actually _****_listening. _**Learn to ask intriguing questions**_ in order to get people to open up. People love talking about themselves, especially when they believe the other person is genuinely interested and listening. You only need to have minimal knowledge on a subject, to ask smart questions. People responses will allow you to ask more questions, and then you find yourself having an entire conversation, simply by _**encouraging them to talk**_.

Certainly, the questions you ask will make the difference. _**Open ended ones are optimal**_, starting with How and What, rather than closed ended ones, like Why or Do. For example, it's  preferable to say “What keeps you busy these days?” rather than the more generic and ordinary “What do you do?” . The first question will induce someone to talk about their professional and possibly personal life, while the second will directly induce them into one straightforward answer. 

#### Disregard your elevator pitch

It is a general advice to have your elevator pitch ready to explain your profession or professional goals, there are even classes taught regarding it. However, how many of these 'pitches' do you truly remember? It is far more engaging and interesting to have a 'normal' conversation with another person \(that you would remember\), then have someone tell you a clever statement that they obviously memorised in order to impress people. Yet, successful networking is about _**connections made on a humane basis**_, enough so in order to make people want to talk to you again. The conversation is supposed to surpass the event, in order to expand your network.

#### Be a friend

The most important factor in networking is just _**being friendly and making new friends.**_ When going to any event or outing you can always be forging new friendships \(hence a larger network\). You should not separate professional networking with making new friends. Just communicate on a humane basis with people, and not just having the conversation so you can get something out of it. Simply talk and approach people, just like you would talk and approach a friend. 

In conclusion, just _**be authentic and try to make a new friends.**_ This automatically takes the stress out of the situation, thus allowing you to be yourself and eventually building stronger connections.

## How to nurture Your Contacts

### Re-introduce Yourself

We connect with so many people virtually and physically all the time, it is hard to keep track of everyone. Once in a while do some **network housekeeping** and **reach out** to the contacts you lost touch with or do not remember what they do exactly. Sometimes losing touch is inevitable, yet you can always contact them and show your interest in what is current with them. 

### Congratulate Them

Now a days, it is easy to remember and view the important moments in other peoples lives with all the platforms we have available. You probably have all your contacts on Facebook and LinkedIn, where you can daily know whose birthday it is and **send them best wishes**, with an email, phone call, or even a birthday card.  

Moreover, there are other occasions to reach out, such as a promotion, change in profession, and anniversary. Where you can **send a congratulatory message** or phone call and ask about the change or event. Make usage of the occasion to catch up on other matters and add an update on your own situation.

### Check-in

Even when there is no specific reason to reach out to a contact, you still can and should. Just **check-in** with them, by **sending a small note or calling them** to see how they are doing. By doing so, you are refreshing their memory of you and providing a window for an update on the both of your professional situations. Where you could also show your appreciation for having them in your professional network.

### Meet them in Person

**Try to meet local contacts annually for a dinner, coffee, or invite them to an event**. A great method is to merge your network with your ongoing schedule, for instance, invite them to an event or workshop you are attending, offer a ticket to a football game, or a coffee date with an interesting person they would like, just send an invite. You should not expect them to accept, but your invitation already makes an impression.

 **For connections abroad**, this may not be possible. Yet ****when you are travelling, you can reach out to your contacts in that city and see if they are available. Ask them to show you the city, or grab a coffee and if the time does not permit, ask for a dinner or bar recommendation. In the worst case, if you do not have time to meet them, send them an email to say that you don't have time on this trip, but you thought of them and wanted to check in. 

### Provide Professional Leads

When you hear something interesting that can help the right people in your network, let them know. Not just employments and references but also speaking opportunities, special projects, board positions, and writing assignments. Provide them with an offer and an introduction, because chances are, a number of your contacts could also help each other out if they only knew each other. If you feel hat an introduction would be beneficial to both parties, and they have both agreed to meet, set it up!

The connection can be positive for all parties involved.  Because you’re also getting an opportunity to help both of your contacts and nurture both relationships simultaneously. You’ll also find generally that this results in both parties asking each other how they know you, and then singing your praises. This continues to cement your status as someone on whom people can rely and go to for help.

### Ask their Opinion

Your contacts are in your network for a reason, so remember to take advantage of their knowledge and experience. While taking care not to contact people too much, reach out when you have a need and you know your contact will be able to assist. Inquire about other matters during the exchange and thank your contact for helping out.

### Host an Event

I’ll often think of a handful of people who should know each other, but haven’t met \(or in some cases, haven’t connected in a while\). A great way to get these folks together efficiently and effectively is to host a casual gathering where they can all interact. They win by meeting, and you win by connecting them and seeing them all at once.

### Give it Time

Wine connoisseurs like Miles from "Sideways" will tell you that letting wine breathe will bring out its true aromas and flavors. This is due to aeration and the warming of wine from the surrounding air. Professional networks, like wine, also need time and air to flourish. Take care to nurture your network and give the people in it the space and room they need to breathe.

As with any habit, it takes time and intention to make these practices feel natural. Consider choosing one method a month and trying it out. If you enjoy it, keep doing it, and then add another. If not, let that one go and give a different method a try. Also, it’s helpful to remember that not all relationships will click, nor will you want to nurture them all. You get to choose.
