# Policy Kitchen

## What is Policy Kitchen? 

Policy Kitchen is a policy crowdsourcing method developed by foraus, using a combination of a digital innovation platform and physical workshops. It enables a diverse network of thinkers to collaboratively generate bottom-up policy recipes for pressing foreign policy challenges.  
_foraus_ secured funding over three years for improving the platform, building knowledge and scaling the community. This empowers program groups of all think tanks to run crowdsourcing campaigns - on their own, in collaboration with other think tanks, and/or with external partners.

## **Why? - The Open Think Tank Network is more than the sum of its parts.**

When working on issues of transnational relevance, it’s silly to stay inside the national bubble. We will make better policy recommendations when drawing on a transnational network. We will also have more impact with coordinated communications to our respective governments. We are in fact experimenting with ways to make global governance more democratic. Why not?

## **What’s in it for me?**

* You can use an advanced crowdsourcing software **to generate content, build your community, and get visibility - for free!**
* You get **support** from our experienced project **team** in running your campaign.
* We invest in developing the platform a**ccording to your needs.**
* You can use Policy Kitchen for your **fundraising** pitches - it has made it easier for us to get money, and it will make it easier for you, too.

## Historical Context 

### Prehistoric

* **“Neuland”** \(2016\) - First experiment with crowd-innovation tech. We made an open call for better migration policies using [crowdicity](https://crowdicity.com/), did 7 workshops in different places, generated &gt;100 ideas with a crowd of 250 people, put them to a high-level jury, let 15 winning authors pitch their ideas to 250 politicians and other VIPs at some glitzy event, and published a [book](http://www.nzz-libro.ch/neuland-migration-schweiz-migrationspolitik-reformideen-foraus.html) with their ideas.
* Several workshops in 2016/17, including with the global network, to figure out **requirements of the community.** Then long journey to evaluate technical options. The choice was made in December 2017.
* Participation in the [**digitalswitzerland challenge**](https://challenge.digitalswitzerland.com/e-democracy-crowdsourced-think-tank-bet-at-even-money/) ****2017/18, competing with major tech companies for fame and glory. Secured 3-year funding by [Engagement Migros](https://www.engagement-migros.ch/en/pioneers/policy-kitchen).

### **Contemporary history**

* Pilot campaign on **global biodiversity protection** since September 2018.
  * _**7 Workshops**_, including in [Berlin](https://www.policykitchen.com/node/65) in Partnership with Polis180 and the Bosch Alumni Network \(first case of transnational collaboration\).
  * Rapidly _**built a network**_ and visibility among major stakeholders around the topic \(where we had neither networks nor expertise before\). This includes a [Jury](https://www.policykitchen.com/group/2/about) with the state secretary on foreign affairs, members of parliament, CEO of WWF, ...
  * _**Generated 43 ideas**_, some of which were handed to the Swiss Delegation at the COP-14 on biodiversity. Currently in selection phase, will lead to publication.
* Pilot campaign **“Towards an AI strategy for Switzerland”** since December 2018
  * _**2 Workshops**_ in [Zurich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jlow-HpojLo&feature=youtu.be) and [San Francisco](https://www.policykitchen.com/node/122) in partnership with Swissnex. Participants include government, academia, NPO, UN, industry \(also Google & Microsoft\), civil society & youth
  * _**&gt;40 new users**_ and _**&gt;20 ideas**_ in 1 week.
  * Ideas are _**submitted**_ to the working group on AI of the Swiss government.

## **So how does this thing actually work?**

### **1. Define challenge**

* “If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask… for once I know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes.” \(Albert Einstein\)
* _**Get feedback on your challenge question**_ from the target audience \(policy makers?\) of your result. This gets you a buy-in from the beginning.
* Know what it should become at the end of the process: _**a paper? A blog series? A project?**_ Think big, start small.

### **2. Set up challenge**

* Once you have a rough idea, get in touch with [policykitchen@foraus.ch](mailto:policykitchen@foraus.ch).
* They will provide you with backend access and a _**proper on-boarding.**_
* Basically, you’ll need a challenge intro text and an image, clarity on the timeline and a selection of mechanism \(crowd, jury, none?\).

### **3. Plan workshops**

* Workshops are used to seed ideas and users, foster community, and get visibility.
* We suggest at least 2-3 workshops in different places.
* You will find below a [Policy Kitchen workshop design](policy-kitchen.md#policy-kitchen-workshop-design-template), yet feel free to make your own.
* _**Get experts and spaces**_ early to avoid rushing with invitations.
* Target your _**core community**_ and _**external stakeholders**_ ****of the issue - the magic is in the mix, ideally vertically \(junior / senior\) and horizontally \(different perspectives\).
* Workshops tend to need some _**budget.**_ Consider event sponsoring or project based [fundraising](policy-kitchen.md#how-about-the-fundraising-part). We can help, yet better do a small thing than nothing at all.

### **4. Engage crowd**

* Use your _**core community and main channels.**_
* Also use the opportunity _**to grow your program**_ by targeting specific people and networks. Spend time identifying stakeholders and multipliers.
* _**Physical workshops are key**_ ****to get people interested. Just posting a link may work, but don’t put all your eggs in this basket.

### **5. Moderate Platform**

* You’ll need 2 or more people _**moderating the activity on the platform.**_ Welcome new participants, value new ideas, ask questions, give pointers to resources and people, discourage abuse. This role can be given to a junior with a witty mind and some basic knowledge about the issue. Time investment is about 1-2 hours per week over the course of your campaign.

### **6. Follow-up with chosen ideas**

* The result of the online process will likely be _**idea drafts,**_ not the ready products. Authors may need some guidance to finalize their work. We usually offer workshops where authors get feedback from experts and peers.
* Your process may also involve an ‘in-house’ team consolidating the output. Make sure you acknowledge the contributors if you do that.

### **7. Make noise**

* Ideas are worthless if nobody hears them. If you _**have decent output,**_ make events around it, invite important people, go wild on social media, etc.

\*This is flexible and experiments are always welcomed. Let us know your ideas!

## **Policy Kitchen Workshop Design Template**

**Duration:** 4 Hours

**Participants:** About _**10 - 40 people**_. We strongly encourage you to ensure diversity, both horizontally \(interdisciplinary, multiple sectors\) and vertically \(mixing senior and junior\).  
****

**Roles:** One person can have multiple roles \(e.g. host, facilitator, representative\), but the roles are distinct and you can empower more people by giving them representative or facilitator roles.

* _**A Host**_ - hosts the entire workshop
* _**Facilitators**_ - hosts a group session on a topic \(~ participants / 10 = facilitators\)
* _**Expert\(s\)**_ - provides brief challenge \(“this is the problem, help us solve it”\), provides advice and feedback to groups, supports group sessions with know-hows, and presents for questions.
* _**Helper\(s\) -**_ for organizational reasons 
* _**Representative of the organiser**_
* _**Representative of the partner**_
* _**Documentation \(**photo & video\) **-**_ a person who documents the workshop

**Requirements:**

* Inspiring space for whole plenary
* Walls/ Whiteboard with standing space for 10 \(as many such walls as facilitators\)
* WiFi, password visible in all relevant places.
* Beamer
* Name tags \(optional\)
* Post-its
* Paper cards \(post-its can also do the job\)
* Pens for all
* Each participant should bring a laptop
* Catering \(drinks/snacks throughout, after-workshop beer\)

**Notes:**

* This format can be cut to 3 hours or extended to 2 days. Talk to us to know how.
* This format doesn’t end with a flurry of useless post-its, but actual, public, output.
* You need to know and communicate where the journey is going, and why you are doing this.
* Policy Kitchen allows you to combine outputs of multiple workshops \(and remote contributions\) in one place.

</table>## **How about the fundraising part?**

Policy Kitchen makes it easier for you to raise funds using a narrative along these lines:

_“Look, we bring all this value and innovativeness to the table: a glitzy Policy Kitchen platform, a kick-ass international community of thinkers, loads of experience running participatory bottom up processes. Here are some of our previous successes \(list\)._

_Now all we need is a little support to run campaign X \(or more\). A little project management, some money to unlock workshops, publications and impact events \(and a modest overhead\). All the rest we already bring with us. This stuff is gonna shape the future and your name will be associated with it.”_

You can now _**use that same narrative**_ referring to Policy Kitchen when you do your fundraising. We would appreciate it if a fraction of the money also went to improving policy kitchen, but at this stage it’s more important that your projects fly.
