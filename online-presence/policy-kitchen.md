# Policy Kitchen

## What is Policy Kitchen? 

Policy Kitchen is a policy crowdsourcing method developed by foraus, using a combination of a digital innovation platform and physical workshops. It enables a diverse network of thinkers to collaboratively generate bottom-up policy recipes for pressing foreign policy challenges.  
_foraus_ secured funding over three years for improving the platform, building knowledge and scaling the community. This empowers program groups of all think tanks to run crowdsourcing campaigns - on their own, in collaboration with other think tanks, and/or with external partners.

Policy Kitchen is supported by[: Migros Pionierfonds](https://www.migros-pionierfonds.ch/de)

## **Why? - The Open Think Tank Network is more than the sum of its parts.**

When working on issues of transnational relevance, it’s silly to stay inside the national bubble. We will make better policy recommendations when drawing on a transnational network. We will also have more impact with coordinated communications to our respective governments. We are in fact experimenting with ways to make global governance more democratic. Why not?

## **What’s in it for me?**

* You can use an advanced crowdsourcing software **to generate content, build your community, and get visibility - for free!**
* You get **support** from our experienced project **team** in running your campaign.
* We invest in developing the platform a**ccording to your needs.**
* You can use Policy Kitchen for your **fundraising** pitches - it has made it easier for us to get money, and it will make it easier for you, too.

## Highlights of Policy Kitchen 

* Pilot challenges on [**Biodiversity**](https://www.policykitchen.com/search/groups/biodiversity?type=challenge) \(autumn 2018\)

  * _7 workshops_, including in[ Berlin](https://www.policykitchen.com/node/65) in partnership with Polis180 and the Bosch Alumni Network \(first case of transnational collaboration\).
  * Rapidly _built a network_ and visibility among major stakeholders around the topic \(where we neither had networks nor expertise before\). This includes a[ Jury](https://www.policykitchen.com/group/2/about) with the state secretary on foreign affairs, members of parliament, CEO of WWF, etc...
  * _Generated 43 ideas_, some of which were handed to the Swiss Delegation at the COP-14 on biodiversity. Currently in the next phase, will lead to publication.
  * In autumn 2019, the [paper](https://www.foraus.ch/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_Policy-Kitchen-Biodiversity_WEB.pdf) "Grassroots ideas to halt biodiversity loss" was published and presented at a multi-stakeholder [event ](https://www.policykitchen.com/group/2/home/topic/biodiversity-challenge-completed-publication-out-now)in Bern.

* The challenge “[**Towards a Swiss AI Strategy**](https://www.policykitchen.com/group/11/ideas)” \(winter 2018/19\):

  * _3 workshops_ were held in Switzerland and San Francisco
  * It aimed at generating inputs for the _Swiss Federal Working Group on AI_
  * In collaboration with swissnex San Francisco and Microsoft, 68 participants representing youth, industry, policy makers, academia, and civil society _generated 38 ideas_ for the working group. A summary can be found[ here](https://www.foraus.ch/2019/02/20/switzerland-to-confirm-robot-as-cabinet-member/).
  * In autumn 2019, the [paper](https://www.foraus.ch/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20191022_Making-Sense-of-AI_WEB-1.pdf) "Making Sense of Artificial Intelligence - Why Switzerland Should Support a Scientific UN Panel To Assess The Rise of AI" was published and presented together with another paper from a Policy Kitchen challenge in front of representatives from international organizations, the Swiss government, academia, civil society organizations and the wider public. This [event](https://www.policykitchen.com/swissaistrategy/topic/towards-ai-strategy-challenge-completed-publication-out-now) took place in Geneva. 

* The challenge “[**EU Digital Policy**](https://www.policykitchen.com/group/11/stream)” \(spring 2019\):

  * This was launched by [**Polis180**](https://polis180.org/), in collaboration with [**Ponto**](https://www.pontothinktank.org/)\*\*\*\*
  * _Several workshops_ were held in Berlin, Heidelberg and Vienna on giving young voters the opportunity to participate actively in shaping and improving the Digital Policy of the European Union
  * The 10 best demands were then selected, put together and _published_ in[ this](http://polis180.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Polis-Brief-9_Brief-Format2.pdf) paper. Since then, they have been further _discussed_ with members of the European Parliament at the Polis180[ event](https://polis180.org/events/26-sep-fuer-eine-gerechtere-zukunftsorientierte-digitalpolitik-in-europa-vorstellung-forderungskatalog-der-policy-kitchen-digitalisierung/) on 26th September 2019 in Berlin.

* The challenge on “[**Towards an AI strategy for Switzerland**](https://www.policykitchen.com/group/towards-inclusive-future-ai/about)” \(spring 2019\):
  * _2 workshops_ in[ **Zurich**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jlow-HpojLo&feature=youtu.be) and[ **San Francisco**](https://www.policykitchen.com/node/122) in partnership with Swissnex. Participants included governments, academia, NPO, UN, industry \(also Google & Microsoft\), civil society & youth
  * More than _40 new users_ and more than _20 ideas_ in 1 week.
  * Ideas have been submitted to the working group on AI of the _Swiss government_.
  * The resulting [paper](https://www.foraus.ch/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20191022_Policy-Kitchen-AI_WEB-2.pdf) "Towards an Inclusive Future in AI - A Global Participatory Process" was published in autumn 2019 and subsequently presented at a multi-stakeholder [event](https://www.policykitchen.com/group/19/stream), together with the paper on a Swiss AI strategy, in Geneva.

## **Policy Kitchen Workshop Design Template**

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFm\_g9OwDI0" caption="\*This video explains how to run a policy kitchen workshop " %}

**Duration:** 4 Hours

**Participants:** About _**10 - 40 people**_. We strongly encourage you to ensure diversity, both horizontally \(interdisciplinary, multiple sectors\) and vertically \(mixing senior and junior\).  
****

**Roles:** One person can have multiple roles \(e.g. host, facilitator, representative\), but the roles are distinct and you can empower more people by giving them representative or facilitator roles.

* _**A Host**_ - hosts the entire workshop
* _**Facilitators**_ - hosts a group session on a topic \(~ participants / 10 = facilitators\)
* _**Expert\(s\)**_ - provides brief challenge \(“this is the problem, help us solve it”\), provides advice and feedback to groups, supports group sessions with know-hows, and presents for questions.
* _**Helper\(s\) -**_ for organizational reasons 
* _**Representative of the organiser**_
* _**Representative of the partner**_
* _**Documentation \(**photo & video\) **-**_ a person who documents the workshop

**Requirements:**

* Inspiring space for whole plenary
* Walls/ Whiteboard with standing space for 10 \(as many such walls as facilitators\)
* WiFi, password visible in all relevant places.
* Beamer
* Name tags \(optional\)
* Post-its
* Paper cards \(post-its can also do the job\)
* Pens for all
* Each participant should bring a laptop
* Catering \(drinks/snacks throughout, after-workshop beer\)

**Notes:**

* This format can be cut to 3 hours or extended to 2 days. Talk to us to know how.
* This format doesn’t end with a flurry of useless post-its, but actual, public, output.
* You need to know and communicate where the journey is going, and why you are doing this.
* Policy Kitchen allows you to combine outputs of multiple workshops \(and remote contributions\) in one place.

</table>## **How about the fundraising part?**

Policy Kitchen makes it easier for you to raise funds using a narrative along these lines:

_“Look, we bring all this value and innovativeness to the table: a glitzy Policy Kitchen platform, a kick-ass international community of thinkers, loads of experience running participatory bottom up processes. Here are some of our previous successes \(list\)._

_Now all we need is a little support to run campaign X \(or more\). A little project management, some money to unlock workshops, publications and impact events \(and a modest overhead\). All the rest we already bring with us. This stuff is gonna shape the future and your name will be associated with it.”_

You can now _**use that same narrative**_ referring to Policy Kitchen when you do your fundraising. We would appreciate it if a fraction of the money also went to improving policy kitchen, but at this stage it’s more important that your projects fly.
