# Introduction

The «Open Think Tank Network» which emerged out of the «_foraus_ global» project – strives for the creation, development, and cooperation of open think tanks around the world. We use innovative crowd-sourcing methods and grassroots structures; creating an engaging platform to create opportunities for people to participate in political debates outside of the traditional fora. We thereby democratise the development of international policy.

This is a live knowledge repository, where we collect and share the experiences as well as extensive knowledge from the members of the Open Think Tank Network. Together, we have more than 10 years of experience in building open think tanks all around Europe.
