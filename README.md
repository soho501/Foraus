# Introduction

The «Open Think Tank Network» which emerged out of the «_foraus_ global» project – strives for the creation, development and cooperation of open think tanks around the world. We use innovative crowdsourcing methods and grassroots structures, creating a participative platform to create opportunities to participate in political debates outside of traditional fora. We thereby democratise the shaping of international policy.

This is a live knowledge repository where we collect and share the experiences and extensive knowledge of  members of the Open Think Tank Network. Our member based counts with more than 10 years of experience building open think tanks in Europe.
