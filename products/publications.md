# Publications

## Summary 

Publications are part of the core business of political think tanks. The process of writing a blog article, a policy brief or getting a paper published seems to raise a lot of questions. The main challenges for upcoming think tanks are the lack of style-guides, recruitment of and communication with authors, missing experience with review processes, best practices on printing and publishing, and finally the final publishing process itself \(promotion/launches/press conferences\).

This document aims to answer these main questions and and therefore help your think tank to get your ideas and inputs out there as quickly as possible while ensuring professionalism and a high quality. The majority of the compiled information derives from foraus guidelines and is based on the knowledge and experience of the community.

## Authors

### Recruitment

### Communication

## Blog 

A think tank blog presents a way to share and present new research and events. It can be the central channel to publish opinions and reading lists as well as highlighting new videos, podcasts, and other multimedia produced by the think tank. Another option is to give some researchers/ experts to keep their own blogs and publish some posts on the think tanks website or blog. 

The Blog should be linked to other digital media tools, for instance; the website, Facebook, Twitter, etc., so that a post would immediately be updated on all services.

### Before writing

_Check, whether you are able to:_

* Come up with a title
* Describe the content in three lines
* Come up with a nice illustration for the post

**If yes, go for it!**

### **While Writing**

_There are five rules of thumb:_

1. It is not an academic paper, so keep the style _'**catchy'**_
2. Just like in the news, the most _**important content comes first**_
3. Write _**your opinion**_
4. Just _**one message**_ per blog-post
5. _**Max. 3500**_ characters \(including spaces\)

\*See below for how to write a Blog Post. 

### After Writing

* Allow a colleague to _**review it**_
* _**Post on Social Media & Website -**_ The editorial staff and your office should post the article on your Website, Facebook page, and on Twitter. Also encourage the writer of the Blog to share it on their personal social media pages, in order to enhance the awareness to the maximum. 
* _**Comments on Platforms -**_ Encourage friends, colleges, and generally people to make use of the comment section on the platforms, to enhance the promotion and discussion on the topic. 

#### Blog Post Guide Template

You want to write a blog? Great! Then forget everything you learned about writing at university. Nested sentences are forbidden here, as are nominal constructions. Instead you have to write in an understandable and concise way. The whole thing is an article, not a university dissertation.

1. **Format**

_**Length:**_

 Max. 3500 characters, including spaces: Better short and crisp than long and boring. 

_**Title:**_ 

The title should be short and draw the reader into the text. By a provocative, surprising statement or by catchwords like "crisis", " mess", "ban". 

The title makes it clear what the blog post is about. For title and lead: short words, no abbreviations. No economic commissions, OSCE decisions or similar word monstrosities. Verbs bring a title to life. The title can be separated by a colon, question mark or exclamation mark.

_Examples:_ 

* Nothing has been understood, nothing has been learned: the Federal Council wants to continue with the Bilateral Agreements.
* First us, then the Flood? Switzerland neglects their climate change duties
* Biodiversity Decline – Are We Heading Towards The Forever Silent Spring?

_**The Lead**_

The lead at the beginning of the text should summarise what the blog is about and intend to encourage the reader to read on. For example, the lead leaves a question open, points out a contradiction or ends with a "cliffhanger" - this is how the reader wants to experience the resolution. 

_Length -_  max. 200 characters including spaces.

_Examples:_

* Switzerland will continue to come under international pressure with regard to its banking secrecy. There are plenty of proposals to save it. Unfortunately, they are all useless.
* As the Belt and Road Initiative becomes a reality, its scope and depth requires China to formulate a clear set of foreign policy principles. The Beijing Consensus has served as an umbrella term encompassing a variety of plans, frameworks and ideas originating from the Chinese leadership. However, does this ‘China model’ really form a comprehensive entity?

In addition, each text should contain bold subheadings. They serve as a breather. Also it applies here: short and clear, leave it open-ended and refer to something that comes in the next section. This should occur approximately every 500 characters. 

_**Formality**_

* Names - always first and last name, even if quoted repeatedly
* Direct speech is better than indirect speech; for long quotes alternate between direct and indirect speech
* Known abbreviations like EU and UN can be used without further explanation. Otherwise, the word must be written out the first time, then the abbreviation in brackets. For example: "The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons \(OPCW\) has decided to ... -" . However, it's not nice if there are too many of them. 

_**Author line and Disclaimer**_

Each text should contain two references to the author \(s\): first and last name\(s\) at the beginning, as well as an italic footer at the end of the text. This footer contains last and first name, age, brief information on education/occupation, place of residence, function at think tank and other information that contributes to the relevance of the text.

_Example:_

Hans Beispiel \(28\) is a lawyer and lives in Winterthur, Switzerland. He is involved with foraus in the Working Group on Human Rights. 

Sabine Muster \(29\), is a political scientist and lives in Basel, Switzerland. She is a guest on the foraus blog. She is a research assistant at the IHEID in Geneva and is primarily concerned with Switzerland's relations with the UN peacekeeping forces in Lebanon.

_Below these author footnotes there is always a disclaimer with the following content:_ 

The foraus blog is a forum that is made available to both foraus members and guest authors. The contributions published here are personal statements of the authors. They do not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editors or the association.

2. **Content**

_**The Set-up**_

As with news, the most important thing first. The central idea and the issue, should be at the beginning. Not everything has to be explained right away, that's what the text is for. But it should be clear what the article is about. Then the text needs a guiding theme, a lead to the topic: it must lead from A to B in an comprehensible way. Delete secondary thoughts \(possibly use them in another blog entry\). 

_Tips:_ already formulate the lead before writing the article. Then you will clearly know what you want to write about. Moreover, it is great to end the blog with a provocative idea or question in order to start a discussion.

_**Style**_

The text should meet journalistic criteria, i.e. it should be appealing to read. It is not a matter of writing a scientific paper. If you don't succeed, think about it: In what way would I inform my colleague about it? You wouldn't tell him about the "tax minimisation practice of companies", but rather about "companies that want to pay taxes as low as possible".

* Short and clear: short sentences and try to explain complicated facts with simple words.
* Be provocative
* Write lively and descriptively \(but avoid overused metaphors\)
* No technical terms
* No active passive
* Personal opinion is important - the blog is an opinion. Also sharp criticism and controversy are okay, the entry should initiate in the best case a discussion.

_**Picture**_

A catchy text also needs a catchy picture. It should:

* Be OpenSource or provided by someone named \(don't just copy it from the web\)
* Not just be any picture for the sake of having a picture in it; but it should attract the eye and draw attention to the text \(articles with good pictures are read much earlier\)
* Match the text and title: No text-image scissors
* Better to display a few and large things/persons instead of many and small things. 

\*Note - the picture should also be placed on Facebook: a picture with many small details is therefore rather unsuitable.

**For Example:** 

* [foraus Blog](https://www.foraus.ch/blog/)
* [Polis Blog](https://polis180.org/polisblog/)

## Discussion Paper/ Policy Brief

### Brainstorming

* Brainstorming an idea within the programs under the direction of the programme leader
* Compose a team of authors \(1-4 people\)
* Develop a concept with a formulated proposal including policy relevance, the structure of the paper, the target group of the paper, an approximate schedule of the paper and the division of work among the authors \(see template below\)

**Output:** Concept Proposal

**Communication:** The concept proposal should first be checked and commented by your programme manager \(period 1-2 weeks\) and then by your managing director \(period 1-2 weeks\). Subsequently, the concept proposal is sent by the programme manager to the community management for information.

#### Concept Proposal Template

At the beginning of each discussion paper, we generate a concept proposal. Then, this  is reviewed and commented on by the programme manager and managing director. The length should not exceed 2-3 pages.

1. _**Title**_
2. _**Policy Question**_ - What problem should the paper address? 
3. _**Policy Relevance**_ - Why is this problem important? \(e.g. national and/or international political context and relevant developments\); Who are the main stakeholders? \(Which stakeholders and/or experts do you plan to contact for this paper?\)
4. _**Plan for Analysis**_ ****-  ****What is the proposed solution \(rough\) and what arguments lead to it? To what extent and by whom can the proposal be implemented / accepted?
5. _**Target Audience**_
6. _**Timetable : 6.1** -_ Deadline for the first draft _/ **6.2** -_ Deadline for External & Internal Review Process_/ **6.3** -_ Planned Publication _\(_Is there a specific date/occasion/political context when a publication makes sense?\)
7. _**Distribution of Work within the team of Authors**_ - \(allocation of responsibilities\)

### Writing \(Authorship\)

Here We Go! On the basis of the concept proposal and taking into account the feedback from your team. 

* Regular exchange with the programme management; there is also the possibility of further optional feedback through the managing director
* Meeting with experts in the field
* The text is written without format in a text program \(Word\)
* Citation key: footnotes with a uniform citation method

### Review Process

For quality assurance purposes, an internal and an external review should be  carried out. The aim of this process is to revise and improve \(e.g. increase policy relevance\) the paper on the basis of constructive feedback.

#### External Review

The first version of the paper should be reviewed by 2-3 external experts. This external review should be organised by the authorship. A good balance between academic and practical expertise is required. The main criterion of this review is to have qualitative and coherent content.

**Output:** Taking into account the feedback from the external reviewers, a second version of the paper is created. It should be clear to what extent points from the reviews were included or rejected.

**Communication:** _Before the review_ - The authors should send the proposal of the selected expert to the Board and engagement manager, which can make suggestions if necessary. After the review: The 2nd version of the paper will be sent to the engagement manager and the Board. 

#### Internal Review

The Board and Management then coordinates the internal review based on the 2nd version of the paper. The review criteria includes: checking for language errors, viewing that the paper is argumentatively coherent, clear themed,  and policy relevant, as well as has concrete recommendations. At the same time, the timetable for publication should be updated in cooperation with the office.

→ The paper can be sent to the authors with suggestions for improvements if necessary \(i.e. there is a 4th version\).

**Output:** Taking into account the internal review, a 3rd or 4th version of the paper is produced.

**Communication:** The 3rd / 4th version of the paper is sent to the Board and Management. 

### Publishing

**Before Publishing:** The administrative office should agree with the incorporation of the reviews and the end product; the paper with the recommendation for publication is submitted to the full executive Board. Where the criteria for publication will be reviewed; the policy relevance, concrete recommendations available, timing, and sufficient internal resources/capacity.

**Communication:** The director and management informs the entire executive board. Without the veto of any member, the board gives authors, managing director and community management the green light for the publication.

* Developing communication and media strategy  
* Formatting the paper \(incl. creation of graphics\) 
* Translating the Executive Summary/Discussion Paper \(if necessary\)
* Presenting the paper and presence in the media

**Output:** The final version of the Discussion Paper/ Policy Brief \(incl. Formats and Graphics\).
