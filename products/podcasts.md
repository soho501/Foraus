## How to develop a Podcast

### Before developing a Podcast

Before deciding to start a Podcast, you should ask yourself several questions and make a set of decisions. 

#### 1. Consider Your Motives

Determine your motives prior to starting is key. You should set what your goal and motivation is for doing a Podcast. For example, to grow your Think Tank or to inform on Foreign Policy; possibly to bring more awareness to your Publications. Thus, your motivation for creating it should inspire the content you share.

#### 2. Can you be consistent?

The ****first ****question ****you should answer, **do you have the resources and time to deliver content?** 

Ideally it should be consistent, whether it is once a week, every 2 weeks, or once a month. You need to be clear about the specific dates and time for your own time management and for your audience to know when to expect a show and thus tune in. 

Therefore; ask yourself, can you create a calendar you can stick to? What would it look like? How much time do you need to devote to recording, editing \(if need be\) and syndicating? What day do you have the most time to post? **Make a weekly or monthly syndication day and stick to it!**

However, if you would rather just do a **Podcast** **series** with for instance 10 episodes. You would have more time to develop and create the content beforehand, and then publish them all at once or every week for around two months. This would be up to the format you chose to have. Just be clear about it beforehand! 

#### 3. Identify your Focus

**Choose** **your** **niche** because when your Podcast lacks focus, your audience won’t know what to expect from your show and, in turn, won’t know what to come to you for. 

Therefore, think about your optimal listener and what you have to offer them— what do you talk about that promptly interests you? Start there and polish your concept until you can set a true theme. For example: focus on National Foreign Policy, or experts to support your Publication. Whatever, you believe can help your motive and format. 

#### 4. Figure out your Format/Style

Every podcast has a **specific** **format**, whether it varies sometimes or not. You should beforehand identify what your style is going to be. There are many different ways you could style your show \([as listed above](podcasts.md#styles-of-podcasts)\), you just need to see what format works best for you, your motives, and your Think Tank.

#### 5. Decide on a Name

The name of your podcast should reflect your style and focus as well as give the audience an idea of what for topics and subjects you will be talking/discussing about. 

When you’ve found a **catchy** **and** **reflective** **name** that you like, first research on podcast platforms if the name is not being used already and to guarantee there aren’t others that sound highly similar.

#### 6. Importance of the Intros & Outros

While you should not write down a script or specific guideline on what to say during your show, since it should sound natural and easy going, you should have a **good plan on what you will say during your intros and outros** - so you will not forget any necessary detail you should mention. Since, the intro should generally entail a brief rundown on what to expect during the show, as well as a brief personal introduction of you and your guests \(if applicable\). Whereas, the outros could entail a teaser for whats to come and  entail a reminder to share the content— these points would make your audience increase. 

They should present as a thread, which links each episode together. For instance, the intro could welcome the audience \(a specific catch phrase\) as well as introduce the topic and the guests, while the outro remind the audience to like, share, comment, and share their opinion on the topic discussed. Possibly also to contribute to a specific workshop or even to subscribe to your newsletter, that depends on your style and format. 

#### 7. Decide on Thumbnail image

**Decide** **on** **a** **representative** **thumbnail**/ **cover** **image**, since it is the one space where you can engage your audience visually. While it may be a simple small picture, it’s what can makes your podcast recognisable.

Therefore, as a Think Tank, it should probably be **your** **logo**. 

#### 8. Equipment needed

**The necessary essentials:** 

* Microphone\(s\)
* Headphones
* A compressor \(more qualitative\)
* A mixer \(if there are many hosts/guests involved\)
* A computer 
* The right software for Podcasts; best recommendation: [Adobe Audition](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html). 

## After doing the Podcast 

Once you have developed your Podcast and have completed your first show, **What do you do now?**

You should first have **people** **review** **it**, before putting it on the internet. **Share it with your co-workers and your board and get their insight** and see what you could do better before making it public. 

#### Where and How do you upload your Podcast?

You do not have to create your own WordPress site to place your Podcast audio files. You can upload it to the iTunes Podcast or/and on soundcloud. You can also create an account on Libsyn, which is a service that allows you to publish your shows easily on places like iTunes and provides you with links for sharing your content as well as shows you analytics on how your show is performing. Podcaster is a similar  German version of Libsyn \(US\).
